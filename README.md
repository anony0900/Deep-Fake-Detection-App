# Deep Fake Detection using ELA and CNN

This project detects deep fake images using Error Level Analysis (ELA) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is trained on real and fake images sourced from Kaggle to classify input images as either authentic or manipulated.

## Features
- Detects deep fake images using ELA method
- Utilizes a CNN-based neural network for classification
- Processes images and highlights modifications using ELA
- Implements image classification using a trained model

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- TensorFlow/Keras for CNN model
- OpenCV and PIL for image processing
- NumPy and Matplotlib for data handling and visualization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anony0900/Deep-Fake-Detection-App.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Deep-Fake-Detection-App
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook DeepFakeDetection.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Load and run the Jupyter Notebook (`DeepFakeDetection.ipynb`).
2. Upload an image for analysis.
3. The notebook will apply ELA and process the image.
4. The trained CNN model will classify the image as real or fake.
5. Results and visualizations will be displayed.
